*I chose not to include any bells and whistles or other enhancements only because I have other time consuming assignments that I have to work on. I did experiment with including archetypes that changes the starting values of your attributes based on what you picked. But again this is NOT implemented.

*Bugs include:
- when completing the game, when the player wins or loses, attributes are not locked and health can be regained.
- I chose not to deplete the magic number when the player heals and make the player always regain 10 health
- attacking while the monster's health is at 0 will deplete the players health still, the monster counter attacks for 5 dmg
- when using skill points, after all 15 are used, the game acts funny with the points. (ie. a player can gain unlimited points by fidgeting with the "plus" and "minus" buttons
