"A Hero's Adventure Game?"

### Description
-- CRUD app that creates a character, updates that character's stats, and also sends the character on an adventure that can change the stats based on the level. Implemented these features using Context and Providers and successfully implemented 90% of the Redux library from scratch. 

Bugs:
-- There is a bug that I encounter that I do not know how to fix. I have only seen this bug one time and I do not know how exactly I can trigger it but I receive a warning about Animated. This warning disappeared soon after popping up and it has never occurred again but I just thought I would let you know about it. The app does work with no issues.

Other:
-- I decided to theme the adventures and the names based off of a cartoon called "The Loud House," which is why the "heroes" all have the same last name. The adventures are prefixed with actual locations from in the show and I removed some of the adjectives to make it more "PG"

Hope you enjoy :)
